# STM32 - FC
STM32 based Quadcopter/Drone Flight Controller
___
This project is work in progress. 
Over the coming months I will be building out the software required to pilot a quadcopter. I will endeavour to keep the software as tidy as possible and to list the components I am using and link out to documentation that I find helpful.

If you have any questions please reach out, this is only a hobby project, so please don't expect me to do it for you ;) But we can all learn from each other :)

Thank you

Guy

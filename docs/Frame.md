# Quadcopter Frame
Since I have a 3D printer I decided to print my own frame. There are lots of suitable frames on [Thingiverse.com](https://www.thingiverse.com/).
The one I chose appears simple to print and symmetrical, hopefully making it easier to control.

This is the main chassis I used [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1206960](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1206960),  
however, I used this arm that prints better: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2867221](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2867221).
